Summary: We took our sketchbooks and observed how patients leave hospitals. You'll be very surprised at what we found!

Body: 

We feel sorry for the state of affairs here. One elderly woman was pulled by her trousers and lifted into the taxi. Another elderly man tried to enter the taxi the usual way, then realised it would be easier to enter back-first.

Patients need support to get into vehicles. A simple solution could be to have a dedicated hospital staff to help out. If this is not practical, then we need to look for a simple support system.

The handrails we saw were actually the handrails for the taxi stand. Since the sick and elderly patients are not going to stand in a taxi queue we need to think of other designs.

What do you think? What could help in such situations?
