Title: SMU - university website

----

Summary: We helped SMU with a strategy to align corporate, school and institute websites.

----

Category: User Research, Content Strategy, Information Architecture, Digital Marketing

----

Client: Singapore Management University

----

Industry: Higher Education

----

Keychallenge: The many SMU websites, from the corporate site to school sites to programme sites, were developed using different technologies. Without a clear direction or guidelines, the result was a highly inconsistent experience.

----

Concept: We created a consistent and scalable information architecture that could be applied across different sites. We also created a topic-based framework that connected different information resources such as news, events, articles, programmes and faculty.

----

Outcome: The SMU website recently won a [top-of-the class global design award](http://www.smu.edu.sg/news/2013/05/31/smus-website-wins-top-class-global-design-award).
