Title: SingTel - content strategy

----

Summary: We helped SingTel realise a new website strategy.

----

Category: User Research, Content Strategy, Information Architecture

----

Client: SingTel Pte Ltd

----

Industry: Telecommunications

----

Keychallenge: SingTel had just undergone a big site redesign. Their strategy was in place and the interface design screens all done up. There was just one catch: the content did not fit! The project was stalled, and they needed a way forward. Thatâ€™s when they called us.

----

Concept: We researched, curated and modelled the content for the websites. From there, we created content templates and new wireframes. Our deliverables helped both the subject matter expert and the copywriter gather and write content. They also helped the visual designer and CMS developer better understand the workflow.

----

Outcome: Execution time frame reduced by 50%. Websites were launched earlier than expected.
