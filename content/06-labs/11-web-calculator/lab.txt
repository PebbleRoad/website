Body: 

## What it is
A free framework to build and maintain web calculators that offer instant answers based on user input.

## Why use it
With web calculators you give users answers, instead of lengthy instructions. They are simple, elegant solutions in a self-service context. But, web calculators, especially complex ones, are difficult to maintain. Organisations don't want to create something that they cannot maintain. This is a reason why we don't see many calculators on the web. Our framework hopes to close this gap. The framework allows a front-end developer (with JavaScript knowledge) to easily build and maintain web calculators.

## Demo
See a demo of an [EMI web calculator](http://pebbleroad.github.io/web-calculator-app/).
