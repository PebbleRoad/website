Body: 

## What it is
A free PHP-based parser that converts [shortcodes](http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode) used in [Gather Content](http://www.gathercontent.com) to HTML. The parser is based on a WordPress shortcode parser.

## Why use it
Authoring plain text pages can be dull to read. As a web author, you may sometimes have a strong desire to [show information in an interactive manner](http://www.pebbleroad.com/perspectives/improving-reading-experience-content-patterns) such as in tabs or in an accordion. But many authoring systems do not allow the use such interactive elements. Now there is a way, at least for those who use [Gather Content](http://www.gathercontent.com) to author pages.

The solution, first introduced in WordPress, is called **shortcodes**. If you wanted to use, say a tab, you would use special markup to structure the tab as such:

~~~~markup
[tabList]
[tab title=”Title 1”] 
	Content goes here 
[/tab]
[tab title=”Title 2”]
	Content goes here [/tab]
[/tabList]
~~~~
There is one more part to the solution - convert the shortcodes to HTML. This is where a parser is necessary. Our parser converts shortcodes in Gather Content to HTML.
