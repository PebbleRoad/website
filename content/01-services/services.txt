  name: Website and app design
  blurb: Website and app design
  description: |
    The demands on websites and apps have risen dramatically over the last few years. We now have to cater to multiple devices, users and channels. New disciplines and developments such as UI animations and conversational UIs have come to the rescue. We are at the forefront of these developments and bring this knowledge to the projects we do.
    
    The activities we do in a website and app project include:
    
    * Analyse top tasks
    * Create microcopy guidelines
    * Create UI patterns
    * Define the information architecture
    * Design interactions and task flows
    * Design the user interface
