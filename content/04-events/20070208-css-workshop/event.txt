Title: CSS workshop with Russ Weakley

----

Body: 

This event was held 8 February 2007.

Russ Weakley's workshop turned out great. Not so much because of the lush, resort-like atmosphere of the place (it certainly helped), but because there was just so much to learn from Russ. His self-deprecating style of humour and his excellent analogies certainly made things even more interesting and enjoyable, despite the technical nature of the content.

All those we spoke to left the workshop very happy. Sure, a few were a little stressed, suddenly realising how much more there was to the world of CSS, but that is probably a good kind of stress.

A big "thank you" to Russ for agreeing to come over to Singapore do this workshop, and to everyone for your support and participation.

We hope that this workshop will help raise the level of web design and CSS competency in Singapore.
