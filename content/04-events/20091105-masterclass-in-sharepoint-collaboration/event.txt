----

Body: 

This event was held 5 November 2009.

We had a full house for this 1-Day Masterclass in Sharepoint Collaboration and Governance by [Michael Sampson](http://www.michaelsampson.net/). This event was jointly organised by PebbleRoad and ToThePoint. The event was held on 5th Nov 2009 at the Hyatt in Singapore.

Michael covered a wide range of subjects from the basics of collaboration to evaluating Sharepoint as a viable collaboration tool to understanding different user adoption strategies.

The focus of Michael’s talk was his plead that it takes more than just installing Sharepoint (or any other collaboration tool) to make collaboration a success in the organisation. His idea was that we have to go beyond doing things to ‘avoid failure’ and start looking at strategies that ‘chase successes’.

Michael’s talk was a mix of conceptual briefings and specific case studies. The audience liked this sequence because it gave them the opportunity to place the concept in their own contexts.

Thank you Michael for coming ‘up’ from New Zealand to share your views and expertise.
