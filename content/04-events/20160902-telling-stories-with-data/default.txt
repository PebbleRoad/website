Body: 

Come learn about content types, the unsung workhorses of your content and UX strategy. Content types are simply recognisable chunks of information such as press releases, blog posts, recipes and events. Not only can they be purposely crafted to help you meet your business and audience needs, but they can also help your content flow in a multi-channel world. 

Join us as we go through why you need content types, how to choose a good mix of them and how to design them.
