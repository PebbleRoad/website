Title: Service design bootcamp with DesignThinkers

----

Body: 

The Service Design Bootcamp was held in Singapore on 21-22 June 2012.

The two days of the bootcamp were a great learning experience. How do we know? There was a lot of reframing going on. That is what service thinking is all about. It challenges the "product" mindset that centres on making, shipping, and supporting a tangible item. But services are different. They are co-created. The customer or consumer cannot be taken out of equation.

Tim Schuurman and James Rock of [DesignThinkers Group](http://www.designthinkersgroup.com/) took participants through an actual exercise in creating a new service or re-imagine and existing service. They used they 10-step Service Innovation Canvas as a framework.

The methods discussed included:

* Stakeholder mapping
* Value mapping
* Journey mapping
* Concept mapping
* Business models

Thanks to all those who attended and many thanks to the DesignThinkers Group for coming all the way from The Netherlands to give this bootcamp.
