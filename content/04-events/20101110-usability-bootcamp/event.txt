Title: Usability bootcamp with Christine Perfetti

----

Body: 

This event was held 10-11 November 2010.

The two-day bootcamp with Christine Perfetti was filled with hands-on exercises and simple tips. Christine took participants through the basics of usability testing and then prepared them for doing their own usability test on the second day.

The big takeaway from this event was that usability testing is not this big, scary, confusing thing that many of us believe it to be, rather, it is something really simple and straightforward. All it takes is a passion for improving the product or service so that it better meets the needs of the customers.

Thanks to Christine for making the long trip from New York and thanks to the participants for making this event a memorable one.
