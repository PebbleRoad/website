----

Summary: Simon Goh is hosting another service design meetup on Wednesday, October 19, 2016. His guest is Ms. Wong Hefen, Senior Assistant Director of the Behavioural Insights and Design Unit (BDU) at the Ministry of Manpower, Singapore.

Body: 

Service design is entering the vocabulary of organisations in Singapore. We see organisations using it to harmonise design disciplines. We also see it in service organisations using it to achieve business and customer experience outcomes. 

One such organisation is the Ministry of Manpower, and we are delighted to have Ms. Wong Hefen share their design journey. If you are evaluating what service design can do for your organisation, figuring out what's needed, or wanting to just discuss some of these challenges you are facing - come join us. 

For folks that are offering design services, this session will help you think about the roles you can play for organisations that are developing their own design capabilities.
